# Empirical Bayes Analysis on Tumor Studies in Rodents

## Introduction
Empirical Bayes methods offer a pragmatic approach to Bayesian inference, simplifying hierarchical models by estimating hyperparameters ($\psi$) directly from the data. This report explores the application of Empirical Bayes in analyzing tumor rates in rodents, highlighting the method's computational efficiency and ability to incorporate prior information.

## Empirical Bayes: An Enhanced Overview
Empirical Bayes methods streamline hierarchical Bayesian models by replacing the hyperparameter vector $\psi$ with a point estimate $\hat{\psi}$ derived from the data. This process involves hierarchical reasoning with a particular strategy to simplify models without sacrificing the Bayesian framework's depth.

### Hierarchical Models in Empirical Bayes
Hierarchical models typically consist of three layers:
1. **First Layer**: A statistical model with a likelihood function $X \sim f(x, \theta)$, dependent on parameter $\theta$.
2. **Second Layer**: A prior for the parameter $\theta$, itself dependent on a hyperparameter $\psi$, denoted as $\theta \sim \pi(\theta, \psi)$.
3. **Third Layer**: A hyperprior for $\psi$, for instance, $\psi \sim g(\psi)$.

The posterior $\pi(\theta, \psi | x)$ is proportional to the product of these three terms. However, computing this posterior often requires a double integral with respect to $\psi$ and $\theta$, which can be intractable. Empirical Bayes simplifies this by estimating $\psi$ with $\hat{\psi}$, effectively reducing the model to two layers:
- **Likelihood**: $X \sim f(x, \theta)$
- **Prior with Estimated Hyperparameter**: $\theta \sim \pi(\theta, \hat{\psi})$

### Estimating $\hat{\psi}$
$\hat{\psi}$ can be estimated through:
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: $\hat{\psi} = \arg\max_{\psi} p(x | \psi)$, where $p(x | \psi) = \int L(\theta, x)\pi(\theta, \psi) d\theta$ is the marginal likelihood.
- **Method of Moments**: Choose $\hat{\psi}$ such that $\pi(\theta, \hat{\psi})$ matches the sample mean and variance of the MLEs of $\theta_i$.

## Application to Tumor Studies in Rodents

### Data Description and Model Specification
This study examines tumor rates across various rodent experiments, modeling each experiment's outcome ($Y_i$) with $Y_i \sim \text{Bin}(n_i, \theta_i)$, assuming that $\theta_i$ follows a $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ distribution.

### Comparison with Previous Methods

Before adopting the Empirical Bayes approach, let's consider the traditional method of estimating $\theta_i$ for the current experiment:

- **MLE for Current Experiment**: For the experiment with 4 tumors out of 14 rats, the MLE of $\theta_i$ is simply the observed proportion, which is $4/14 \approx 0.286$. This estimate does not account for any prior knowledge or data from previous experiments.


### Utilizing Jeffreys' Prior

In Bayesian analysis, Jeffreys' prior is a non-informative prior that is chosen to be invariant under reparameterization. For the binomial model you're considering ($Y_i \sim \text{Bin}(n_i, \theta_i)$), Jeffreys' prior is $\text{Beta}(1/2, 1/2)$. This choice of prior is particularly useful when there is little to no prior information about the parameter $\theta_i$.

For the new experiment with 4 tumors out of 14 rats, applying Jeffreys' prior means starting with a $\text{Beta}(1/2, 1/2)$ prior for $\theta_i$. When we update this prior with the new data (4 successes out of 14 trials), we use the formula for updating a Beta prior with Binomial data, which results in a new posterior distribution:

$$\pi(\theta | y) = \text{Beta}(\alpha + y, \beta + n - y)$$

Here, $y = 4$ (number of tumors), $n = 14$ (total number of rats), and our initial $\alpha$ and $\beta$ from Jeffreys' prior are $1/2$. Thus, the updated posterior distribution is $\text{Beta}(4.5, 10.5)$.

The mean of a Beta distribution $\text{Beta}(a, b)$ is given by $\frac{a}{a + b}$. Applying this to our posterior distribution $\text{Beta}(4.5, 10.5)$:

$$\text{Mean} = \frac{4.5}{4.5 + 10.5} = \frac{4.5}{15} = 0.3$$

This calculation shows why the posterior mean is 0.3 under Jeffreys' prior. The choice of Jeffreys' prior, which is more diffuse (less informative) compared to a prior that might come from concrete prior data, leads to a posterior mean that is slightly larger than the MLE estimate (0.286) from the new experiment alone. This difference illustrates how the choice of prior affects posterior estimates, with Jeffreys' prior providing a balance between complete ignorance and any specific prior knowledge.

The posterior mean using Jeffreys' prior (0.3) is slightly higher than the MLE estimate (0.286) for the new experiment, indicating a subtle but important impact of incorporating a non-informative prior into the analysis. It illustrates a key Bayesian insight: even a non-informative prior can gently shift estimates, emphasizing the integration of all available information, including the structure of the problem itself (as captured by Jeffreys' prior), into our inference.

Next, I discuss the Empirical Bayes method, which utilizes historical data to inform the prior.

### Empirical Bayes Estimation
Adopting an Empirical Bayes approach allows us to integrate historical data for a more informed estimate:
1. Compute the MLEs from previous experiments.
2. Determine the sample mean ($m = 0.136$) and variance ($v = 0.0106$) of these MLEs.
3. Estimate $\hat{\alpha} = 1.4$ and $\hat{\beta} = 8.6$ so that the Beta distribution matches the observed sample moments.
4. Update the posterior to $\text{Beta}(5.4, 18.6)$ based on the new experiment, leading to a posterior mean of $\theta_{EB} = 0.225$.

### Why Empirical Bayes is More Conservative
The Empirical Bayes estimate ($\theta_{EB} = 0.225$) is more conservative compared to the MLE estimate ($0.286$) from the current experiment alone. This discrepancy illustrates the Empirical Bayes method's advantage: it leverages prior information from previous studies to temper the estimate, reducing the potential for overestimation based on a single experiment's data.

## Conclusion
The empirical Bayes estimate for the new experiment reflects a more conservative tumor rate estimation than the MLE approach, emphasizing the importance of incorporating existing data. This method not only simplifies the analysis but also improves estimate accuracy by leveraging the strength of prior knowledge, proving especially
# Report on Non-Parametric Empirical Bayes Analysis for Product Ratings

## Introduction

In the realm of e-commerce, accurately gauging the quality of products through customer ratings is pivotal for both consumers making informed choices and retailers aiming to improve their offerings. The variability in the number of reviews across products, however, poses a significant challenge in assessing product quality uniformly. To address this issue, we have applied non-parametric empirical Bayes methods to estimate the true average ratings of products based on observed 5-star rating proportions, offering a more reliable comparison across a broad spectrum of products.

## Non-Parametric Empirical Bayes: An Overview

Traditional Bayes methods require specifying a prior distribution, which is often subjective and may not accurately reflect the data's underlying structure. Non-parametric empirical Bayes (EB) extends these methods by estimating the prior distribution directly from the data without assuming a specific parametric form. This flexibility is particularly advantageous in contexts where the underlying distribution of parameters is complex or unknown.

The key strength of non-parametric EB lies in its ability to estimate the entire distribution of a parameter, enhancing the precision of parameter estimates for each observation. This approach surpasses linear shrinkage methods by minimizing compound risk over a broader class of estimators, thereby improving the reliability of inferences made from the data.

## Application to Product Ratings

Given the disparity in the number of ratings between established and newly introduced products, accurately comparing their quality can be challenging. By employing non-parametric EB methods, we aimed to generate more reliable estimates of product quality, especially for those items with scant review data.

### Methodology

Our analysis comprised two primary steps within the non-parametric EB framework, focusing on the distribution of 5-star rating proportions across products:

1. **Estimation of the Prior Distribution**: We estimated the shape of the underlying distribution of 5-star rating proportions across all products without presuming a specific parametric form, making our approach genuinely non-parametric.

2. **Adjustment of Proportion Estimates**: With the estimated prior distribution, we then adjusted the observed proportions of 5-star ratings for each product to reflect the variability in review counts more accurately, aiming to provide a closer estimation of each product's true quality.

### Results

The non-parametric EB analysis led to adjusted proportions of 5-star ratings that more accurately reflect the true quality of the products compared to the original, unadjusted proportions. For instance:

- Product 0's 5-star rating proportion was adjusted from 0.333333 to 0.322610.
- Product 4 saw its 5-star rating proportion adjusted from 0.600000 to 0.520850.

These adjustments underscore the efficacy of non-parametric EB methods in refining our estimates, particularly for products with fewer reviews, thereby enabling a fairer comparison across products.

## Conclusion

The non-parametric empirical Bayes approach offers a potent tool for enhancing parameter estimates in various applications. By estimating the prior distribution directly from the data, this method facilitates more accurate and dependable inferences, especially in situations where information is sparse. Our product ratings analysis showcases the practical benefits of non-parametric EB, providing deeper insights into product quality that can aid both consumers and retailers.

This approach's versatility is further illustrated by its application in estimating expected claims for policyholders, where non-parametric EB methods are used to adjust observed claim frequencies to predict future occurrences more accurately. Like in product ratings, this application underscores non-parametric EB's ability to derive more reliable estimates from observed data, highlighting its wide-ranging utility in empirical research.

By directly estimating the hyperprior distribution from the data through non-parametric empirical Bayes, we not only adapt our models more closely to the real-world data but also open avenues for more nuanced and data-driven decision-making processes across various fields of study.
