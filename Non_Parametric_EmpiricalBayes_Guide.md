## Expanding on Non-Parametric Empirical Bayes

### The Concept of Non-Parametric Empirical Bayes

Unlike traditional empirical Bayes that estimates a hyperprior distribution by identifying a point estimate for the hyperparameter, non-parametric empirical Bayes aims to estimate the hyperprior (or marginal) distribution directly from the data. This approach does not assume any specific parametric form for the distribution, hence the term "non-parametric." It's particularly useful when the underlying distribution of parameters is complex or not well-understood.

### Illustrative Example: Poisson Model

Consider a scenario where $Y_i \sim \text{Po}(\theta_i)$ independently, with $\theta_i$ drawn independently from some unknown distribution $\pi$. The goal is to estimate $\theta_i$ for each observation based on the empirical data, without assuming a specific form for $\pi$.

#### Non-Parametric Approach

Using the non-parametric empirical Bayes method, we do not assume $\theta_i$ are identically distributed from a known distribution. Instead, we use the data to estimate $\pi$. For instance, the posterior mean $\hat{\theta}_i$ is given by:

$$\hat{\theta}_i = E[\theta_i | Y_i] = \frac{(Y_i + 1)p(Y_i + 1)}{p(Y_i)}$$

where $p(y)$ is the marginal probability mass function (pmf), approximated by the observed frequency of data points equal to $y$. This approach is essentially leveraging the empirical distribution of the data to inform our estimates.

### Python Example: Implementing Robbins' Method

To apply Robbins' method for estimating $\hat{\theta}_i$ as described, we could use the following Python code to process an array of observation counts:

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample data: counts of observations
observed_counts = np.array([7850, 1320, 240, 40, 15, 5, 3, 2])

def robbins_estimator(observed_counts):
    """
    Apply Robbins' estimator to approximate theta_i for a Poisson model.
    """
    # Calculate the marginal pmf approximations
    p_hat = np.zeros_like(observed_counts, dtype=float)
    for i in range(len(observed_counts)-1):
        p_hat[i] = observed_counts[i+1] / observed_counts[i]
    
    # Calculate theta_hat using Robbins' formula
    theta_hat = [(i + 1) * p_hat[i] for i in range(len(p_hat)-1)]
    return theta_hat

# Calculate the Robbins' estimates
theta_hat = robbins_estimator(observed_counts)
print("Robbins' estimates for theta_i:", theta_hat)
